# CSCI 310 Project 
## Easy Team Up

## 3 main features

###### Feature 1: View Active Events
Users are able to view all public event invitations. This can be displayed: (1) in a list (2) in a map where
each event was marked based on their location. By clicking the event, users can view the details of the
post. The user can choose to sign up for events and choose time slots that work for themselves. This
action will notify the owner of the post. After the due time, the app will determine the time for an event
satisfying most participants and notify everyone of them.

###### Feature 2: Create Event Invitations
The user can create event invitations. In the invitation, they can specify the type of event, proposed time
slots, due time and other information specific for different types of event. They can also invite someone
(by searching user ID) to join the event in the post. Each post can be made public which can be joined by
all people or private which only invited people can view and join.

###### Feature 3: Manage Invitations
Users can track their event history including posts created by them, they received and the events they
signed up for. For their own posts, they can also make changes to it before the due time, which will notify
all participants. For invitations they received, they can choose to accept or reject. They can also withdraw
from the event they signed up for, which will notify the owner.
