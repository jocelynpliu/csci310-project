# CSCI 310 Project - Easy Team Up

1. Unzip the zip file somewhere on your computer, maybe your desktop.
2. Open Android Studio.
3. Click "File", then "Open..."
4. Navigate to where the zip file was unzipped. Click on the folder. It should be called cs310-project.
5. It should open, and display a bunch of folders including "app" and "Gradle". There should be a README.md there too. 
7. In Tools > Device Manager, create a device. We used the Pixel 2, with API level 28 "Pie".
8.  Now in the top left, the "app" module should be selected. If you click the green arrow next to "Pixel 2 API 28", the app should run.
9. It may take a second to load. You can create an account, or use 
username: "tapeters"
password: "mypassword"

Thanks!
Let me know if you have problems.

## 3 main features

###### Feature 1: View Active Events
Users are able to view all public event invitations. This can be displayed: (1) in a list (2) in a map where
each event was marked based on their location. By clicking the event, users can view the details of the
post. The user can choose to sign up for events and choose time slots that work for themselves. This
action will notify the owner of the post. After the due time, the app will determine the time for an event
satisfying most participants and notify everyone of them.

###### Feature 2: Create Event Invitations
The user can create event invitations. In the invitation, they can specify the type of event, proposed time
slots, due time and other information specific for different types of event. They can also invite someone
(by searching user ID) to join the event in the post. Each post can be made public which can be joined by
all people or private which only invited people can view and join.

###### Feature 3: Manage Invitations
Users can track their event history including posts created by them, they received and the events they
signed up for. For their own posts, they can also make changes to it before the due time, which will notify
all participants. For invitations they received, they can choose to accept or reject. They can also withdraw
from the event they signed up for, which will notify the owner.
